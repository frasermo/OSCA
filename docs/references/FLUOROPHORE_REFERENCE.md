# Fluorophore Excitation Reference

**Multiband filter (DAPI/Green/Orange)** — example bandpasses
- Excitation: 375±28 nm, 475±40 nm, 560±35 nm
- Emission: example band at 625±40 nm (Texas Red)

**Texas Red filter set** — separate cube with matched excitation/dichroic/emission.

> Always verify your fluorophore spectra vs LED wavelengths and filter sets when planning experiments.
