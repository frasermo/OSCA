# Maintenance & Cleaning

## Optical
- Wear powder‑free gloves near optics.
- Use a **bulb blower** to remove visible dust on objectives only when artefacts are seen.
- Do not touch optical surfaces unless instructed by support.

## Software
- Run `/openScope/update.sh` on the laptop to reinstall dependencies if needed.
- Check GitHub monthly for updates.
