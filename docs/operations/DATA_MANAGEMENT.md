<!-- # Data Management

- Save acquisitions to **D:\/** (temporary). Create a folder per user/institution.
- **Do not** save to **C:\/** (reserved for OS and imaging software backend).
- **D:/** is purged periodically; copy data to external USB or institutional cloud at session end.
- Verify integrity by reopening a subset before deleting from **D:\/**.

**Formats & Naming**
- TIFF (8‑ or 12‑bit), AVI for time‑lapse.
- Example naming: `YYYYMMDD_SampleID_UserInitials_Mode.tif` (e.g., `20250620_EColi_FM_BF.tif`).
- TIFF headers embed metadata (exposure, illumination, objective, notes) when supported.

**Security & Backup**
- Keep at least **two** independent copies (local+external, or local+cloud).
- Encrypt sensitive/unpublished data if required by policy.
- Follow your institution’s data retention/sharing rules. -->
