# IRIS‑400 Setup & Operation

- Power on **OF22** controller.
- Select wavelength **R/G/B/UV** with front buttons. A red dot indicates the selected channel.
- Turn the right‑side dial to set intensity for the selected LED.
- Press the **button below** the LED indicator to toggle **illumination ON**.

**Good practice**
- Start with longer wavelengths (R/G) and low intensity; increase gradually to minimize photodamage and thermal drift.
